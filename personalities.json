One of her most interesting creations was a chess set painted on the nails of a grandmaster, who was using her fingernails as a ploy to distract her opponent in a championship match.  Petra watched the match (which her client won) and learned a bit about chess in the process.",

He frequently escaped from his doctoral thesis by playing chess with fellow students at the campus pub, where he was known as 'that guy who's always there in the corner'. To celebrate, he put everything he owned into storage and moved to Australia, although it is certain that he is still making friends and playing chess regularly. Although, now he's called 'that guy who's behind the bar', as he has found his true calling as a bartender. Never a serious student of chess, Will plays logically, but often comes up short in the endgame. ",

He was already becoming a complete player rated around 1800 and competing almost exclusively against adults, he could slash through a tactical melee or eke out a win in an even end game. ",

Blessed with a prodigious memory, Zukertort could recall countless games and variations, a trait that served him well as co-editor of the Neue Berliner Schachzeitung. In many ways, Zukertort was the Baron Munchausen of chess. In a fanciful account of his early life, he claimed fluency in nine languages, and boasted of being a crack pistol shot, an accomplished swordsman, and a veteran of military campaigns he never fought in. One witness overheard him holding a visitor from India spellbound with a convincing and detailed description of a tiger hunt he never took part in. He was seized by a stroke while playing at Londons famous Simpsons Divan and died the next day.",

He was world champion for only one year after beating Botvinnik in 1960 but lost the rematch in 1961. Although plagued with ill-health, Tal always remained a favorite with the fans. His witty book 'The Life And Games Of Mikhail Tal' (1976) is a classic that will be enjoyed by future generations.",

Spassky disobeyed orders to return home and sportingly continued playing after he amassed a two-point lead when Fischer failed to show up for their second game. However, Spassky could not withstand Fischer`s fierce onslaught and although he fought valiantly, lost his title. Soviet authorities punished him for losing to an American.

He learned chess at 16 and devoted his life to the game, remaining one of the top four until after WWI. He might have become world champion, but being a poor Jewish person from the ghetto never got backing for a shot at the title. His greatest victory came at Carlsbad 1907 with everyone there except Lasker, then by a tie for first with Lasker (whom he beat) at St. Petersburg 1909. Rubinstein`s last hurrah came at Vienna 1922. A lifelong shyness developed into a persecution complex. 'There is scarcely another master who suffers so from nerves, which cause him moments of complete exhaustion so that he commits crude blunders,' noted Reti.",

    "bio": "Aaron Nimzowitsch, born in Riga, Latvia, was the greatest player of the hypermodern school. In 1922 he emigrated to Denmark and from a small rented room in Copenhagen penned 'My System' and other classics that deeply influenced future generations. His finest result was winning Carlsbad 1929 ahead of Capablanca but a compulsion to prove his 'unorthodox' theories and 'mysterious' moves sometimes proved costly in tournaments. He made decisive contributions to opening theory; he revived the Winawer Variation of the French Defense, the Queen`s Indian and Nimzo-Indian Defense. He also coined many memorable phrases such as 'the pawn has a lust to expand,' 'prophylaxis' and 'the bishop bites on granite.' Two of his most famous disciples are Petrosian and Karpov.",

In 1947, he set a blindfold record by taking on 45 players simultaneously (+39 -2 = 4). From 1950 to 1976, Najdorf fielded first board on the Argentine team in 11 Chess Olympiads.  In 1949, he drew a match with Fine (+2 -2 = 4) and then lost two matches against Reshevsky in what became known as the championship of the free world. In a long career he was champion of three nations: Poland, Hungary and Argentina. He always played colorful chess and conducted the middle game with virtuosity; but at the highest level his skill in the opening and ending did not match his leading contemporaries. One of the most popular lines in the Sicilian Defense, the indestructible Najdorf Variation, (1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6) was named in his honor.",

An idol in his own country, since 1999 Leko has been supported by RWE Gas AG in Dortmund, Germany, an unusual arrangement for top players. His greatest weakness is a lack of aggression and a tendency to agree to peaceful draws. But he is extremely hard to beat and competitors often refer to him as 'bulletproof'. To improve, he hired a professional coaching team consisting of three Grandmasters, and on all his travels he is accompanied by his Armenian wife, Sofie.

His play faltered after 1971 when Fischer trounced him 6-0 in a world championship qualifying match; yet Larsen remained in demand from organizers because he always plays to win and takes calculated risks that delight spectators.",

Over a period of 18 months, leading up to July 2000, Kramnik set a record by remaining undefeated in over 80 games played at the highest level. He quickly gained the distinction as one of the few who was able to give Kasparov a run for his money. Before their Braingames title match at London in October 2000, where Kramnik astonished everyone by winning, they had met 23 times at classical time limits, and the score was three wins apiece with 17 draws. Since then, however, Kramnik has been relatively inactive. Despite a triumph at Dortmund in 2001, his results have fallen below expectation, and many fans do not consider him a worthy successor to Kasparov. A unification match planned for October 2003 may settle the issue of who is the best player on the planet.",

Fischer`s ambition was firmly set on the world championship and in 1972 he got his chance. He was set to play Boris Spassky for the title. No match in the history of the game received more publicity. Fischer soundly defeated Spassky and became the first American to win the world championship. He then withdrew from serious play and in 1975 forfeited his title to Karpov. He became a recluse and did not compete again until 1992 when a Yugoslav entrepreneur organized a rematch with Spassky for $5 million ($3.35 million to the winner and $1.65 million to the loser). Once again Fischer defeated his old rival and once again vanished from the public eye, probably forever.",

After the first World War he was considered so invincible that his nickname became 'the chess machine.' In 1921 he captured the world championship from Lasker, but then surprisingly lost it to Alekhine in 1927. His intuition was phenomenal, his speed incredible.

    "bio": "Born in Portsea, Hampshire, Henry Edward Bird was one of the leading British amateurs of last century and is best known today by the opening named after him (1. f4). He learned chess at age 10 by watching players at a coffee house in London; by 16 he was a regular at the Divan in the Strand. He was strong enough to be invited to the first great international tournament at London 1851. When he lost to Morphy in 1858 Bird was only 28 and remained active for almost another 50 years. An outstanding accountant, he wrote a book entitled 'An Analysis of Railways in the United Kingdom' and also authored several chess treatises.",

This personality cares little for chess theory, and will gleefully choose openings generally regarded as bizarre, often ignoring positional considerations to pursue the attack for all it is worth. Don't underestimate its playing strength, however, as it has beaten several other Wizard personalities, particularly in games with fast time controls."

Nonetheless, Anderssen`s victory at the first great modern tournament in London 1851 established him as the best player in the world until he lost a close match to Steinitz in 1866.",

In 1995 he dropped a PCA world championship match to Kasparov despite taking an early lead by drawing the first eight games and winning the ninth. In 1998 he dropped a short FIDE title bout to Karpov in overtime after achieving a 3-3 tie. Later that year Anand won Linares ahead of Kasparov and five other top rated stars, yet he declined another shot at the PCA title because of contractual obligations to FIDE.",

Alekhine`s personality left a lot to be desired; he was devious, nervous, restless, and a heavy smoker and drinker. Though a chess genius in his own right, he held his contemporary and rival, Capablanca, in very high regards. Surprisingly, in 1927, he toppled Capablanca to gain the world championship and then studiously avoided any subsequent rematch. Alekhine`s penchant for drink caught up with him with his loss to Euwe in 1935. He then gave up drinking and smoking to regain it in 1937. During World War II he played in many tournaments in Germany and German-occupied countries. After the war he was criticized as an anti-Semite, a charge he firmly denied. He spent the last years of his life in Spain as he was endeavoring the British Chess Federation to organize a match between him and Botvinnik.",
